## Introduction

QData is a program for viewing and editing Qlik View/Sense data files, so-called QVDs. This
enables BI developers to view QVD files without having to load them into Qlik Sense via
an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) process. This saves time and resources. Therefor QData
uses the QVD reader/writer library [PyQvd](https://github.com/MuellerConstantin/PyQvd)
internally.
