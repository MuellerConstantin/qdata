## Introduction

QData is a desktop application for viewing and editing files in the proprietary
Qlik View Data (QVD) format. The application is written in Python and uses the
[PyQvd](https://github.com/MuellerConstantin/PyQvd) library to process QVD files
internally. The application allows you to view the contents of a QVD file, edit
the data, and save the changes back to the file. This enables BI developers to
view and edit QVD files without having to load them into Qlik Sense/Qlik View.

With QData you can: Analyze the structure of a QVD file, view the data in a
structured table, edit the data in the table, and save the changes back to the
file. The application is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean
interface that makes it easy to navigate and use. With just a few clicks you
can search for missing values and duplicates. Filters can be applied to the
data and the data can be sorted based on individual values. Furthermore, you
can also search for values and much more.
